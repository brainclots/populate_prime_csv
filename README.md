This script is to assist in populating a CSV file for use with Cisco Prime
Infrastructure. Prime can push templates (scripts) out to configure devices
but the variables required by those scripts must be obtained from the devices
prior to execution. This script gathers the required information from devices
and populates the file so that the templates can work.
